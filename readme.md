## Malware Detection using machine learning, deep learning techniques
Malware is a serious threat to the security of computer systems, and traditional signature-based methods are ineffective in detecting new and unknown malware samples.  As a result, there is a pressing need for effective malware detection systems that can identify and prevent malware from infecting systems. In this paper, we propose a malware detection system using deep learning. The proposed system uses a deep neural network to learn the features of malware samples and classify them into different categories. We evaluate the performance of the proposed system on a dataset of real-world malware samples and show that it achieves high accuracy in detecting malware.

The rapid increase in the use of computer systems and the internet has led to a rise in the number of malware attacks. Malware refers to malicious software that is designed to harm computer systems or steal sensitive information from them. Malware can be spread through various means, such as email attachments, downloads from the internet, or through vulnerabilities in software. In recent years, machine learning has shown great promise in various fields, including malware detection. Machine learning models can learn the features of malware samples and classify them into differentÂ categories.
